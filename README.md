# 🏠 Student Housing  — Web Application

This project is a Student Housing web application designed to help students easily explore apartments near universities in Tampa. The app provides categorized listings such as furnished units, pet-friendly housing, studios, and 1–3 bedroom apartments. Users can browse properties, view amenities, and access detailed descriptions, making it simpler to find comfortable and affordable student accommodation. The application includes pages for Home, Search, About Us, Contact, and Sign In, providing a smooth navigation experience. 

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, this project demonstrates a full-stack web development workflow with dynamic routing, responsive UI components, and an interactive search/filter system. The goal of the app is to give students a clean, user-friendly platform to compare different housing options and make informed living decisions near USF and surrounding areas.
